### Most Powerful Topics You MUST Know to Build a Chip Startup (2025–2030 Reality)
| Priority | Topic / Skill                                      | Why It’s Critical for a Startup                                                                 |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | System-on-Chip (SoC) Architecture & RISC-V         | Almost every new Indian/European/US chip startup is RISC-V based (Tenstorrent, Ventana, SiFive)        |
| 2       | Digital ASIC Flow (RTL → GDSII) on 7nm/5nm/3nm      | You need to tape-out on TSMC/Samsung/GlobalFoundries – this is the core skill                       |
| 3       | Physical Design + Static Timing Analysis (STA)     | 90% of tape-out delays & failures happen here – startups die without strong PD engineers           |
| 4       | Analog/Mixed-Signal & Custom Layout (FinFET/PDK)   | AI chips, PMICs, SerDes, Data converters – all need analog talent (very rare & high salary)        |
| 5       | Design for Test (DFT), Scan, MBIST, ATPG           | No fab will accept your chip without 98%+ test coverage                                             |
| 6       | Low-Power Design (Clock/Power Gating, UPF/CPF)        | Power is the #1 spec in mobile/AI/automotive chips                                                  |
| 7       | Chiplet Design & UCIe/D2D Interfaces               | Future is chiplets (Intel AMD, Apple, Tesla Dojo) – startups ignoring this will lose                 |
| 8       | AI Accelerator Architecture (Systolic Arrays, TPU-like) | Every new startup is building domain-specific AI chips (Groq, Cerebras, Lightmatter, India’s Shakti-E) |
| 9       | Open-Source PDK + Skywater 130nm & GF180MCU       | Lets you tape-out for <$10k (critical for bootstrapped startups)                                    |
| 10      | Functional Safety (ISO 26262) & DO-254 (if automotive/aerospace) | Mandatory for raising Series A/B in auto segment                                              |
